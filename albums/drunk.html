        <h1>Drunk</h1>
        <h2>By:Thundercat</h2>
         <h2>Rabbot Ho</h2>
        <p>With a dissenate bass line and a synth following  thundercats slow melody. This is harmonically interesting but little boring if it was  any longer the 39 sec.</p>
        <h2>Captain Stupido</h2>
        <p>Just like I said earlier from slow somber parts to boom a shredding song with some funny lyrics thrown in this is a prime example of Thundercats talent as a bass player with techinal speed and skill shinning  through the goofy lyrics song on top of it all. Again not to long in length at just a 1:41 this song just shredds till you know you are left with a nice burb and on to the next one</p>
        <h2>Uh Uh</h2>
        <p>Starts with this eerie muted synth that slowly starts to phase into another shredding jam track. This one doesn't have any words exactly but you do see Stephen Bruner(Thundercat's real name) single some vowels over the shredding drum n bass shred song. This is a bit more remminscent of his  first  album The Golden Age of The Apocalypse which has a lot more instrumental eletronic moments. This is one of my personal favorite jam tracks from  the  cat himself</p>
        <h2>Bus In These Streets</h2>
        <p>Starts with a pretty simple cutesy intrusmental then has a nice melody from  Thundercat sining a bit more on it. Talking about topics that are pretty relavent in our times with how glued to technology people can be now. How we also feel that it is a necessity to stay in the loop of media. If you aren't you feel like you missing out on something. Then in verse 3 when you lose your phone at the track starts to breakdown a bit and become much more simple to its couple main ideas.</p>
        <h2>A Fan's Mail (Tron Song Suite 2)</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite songs from Thundercat. I think the incredibly chill and calming instrumental with the meows he lays on top is goofy but once again what did you expect listening to a artist named Thundercat. This songs lyrics go into talking about how cool it would be a to be a cat in the literal meaning in the first verse but then more like a jazz cat in the second verse. This song is very creative and catchy that I'll catch myself  around  people slightly singing "meow meow meow" and not even realize it because it just blends into the music at one point. I love when artists don't take themselves that seriously and laugh at themselves for a bit. But still do  it in a way that is genuinely good and not just a gimmick</p>
