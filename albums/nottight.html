        <h2>Louna's Intro</h2>
        <p>This starts with such a calming peaceful little medley from <span class="test">DOMi</span>. This little minute long song really highlights <span class="test">DOMi's</span> origins of growing up with a classical background since she grew up playing in a conservatory. I think its a good length I don't ever get bored of it and usually don't skip it.</p>
        <h2>WHATUP</h2>
        <p>This is might be the best example of what their sound sounds like. You get a nice ripping solo from both of them. It is probably why it is the first full song on the album. The production isn't the best on this song I do get it is dry but I mean <span class="jd">JD</span> recorded it with a laptop microphone so it makes sense why. For some listners that are used to following the drums for a since of time might find it hard to feel the pulse but that's why the work so well together. <span class="jd">JD</span> almost vomit styling drumming can be overwhelming if it wasn't for <span class="test">DOMi</span> slow and simple way of laying the main idea over it all to give you that feel. This is something similar Prince would do with tracks like The Beautiful Ones where the drums are a bit hard to follow and then the keys come in with this soild 8th note rhythm that ties all of it together. This is a theme in <span class="test">DOMi</span> & <span class="jd">JD</span> <span class="beck">Beck's</span> music where <span class="test">DOMi</span> is  really laying down the path and <span class="jd">JD</span> is ad libbing in the pockets.</p>
