        <h1>NOT TiGHT</h1>
        <h2>By: DOMi & JD Beck</h2>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Not Tight is the debut album from new duo DOMi & JD Beck. It features Domitille Degalle on keyboards and JD Beck on drums. With many features that can connect with the oldest listeners with Herbie Hancock on MOON and the young kids with Mac DeMarco on TWO SHRiMPS. Blending the old and new is really the most brilliant part about the duo. You can hear the mix of dry production like in a 70s fusion jazz album with all of the same harmony from DOMi and boom drunk dilla time JD is laying down. For people not into more instrumental music one of the singles is the song Take A Chance featuring Anderson .Paak on the verse rapping in 7/4 and DOMi and JD singing the best hook I have heard maybe ever. I had this hook stuck in my head for a month when this song came out.</p>
        <p>Since this is my first review on here I really wanted to start it off with one that I think has the potential to be the new path for this generation of artists. Anyway how I am going to do review albums  (for now) I am going to give them a quick description then lead them with my thoughts on each song in order of the album. Then do a ranking of each song  in the order from least like to most liked. Stuff might change later but anyway lets get this show on the road</p>
        <h2>Louna's Intro</h2>
        <p>This starts with such a calming peaceful little medley from DOMi. This little minute long song really highlights DOMi's origins of growing up with a classical background since she grew up playing in a conservatory. I think its a good length I don't ever get bored of it and usually don't skip it.</p>
        <h2>WHATUP</h2>
        <p>This is might be the best example of what their sound sounds like. You get a nice ripping solo from both of them. It is probably why it is the first full song on the album. The production isn't the best on this song I do get it is dry but I mean JD recorded it with a laptop microphone so it makes sense why. For some listners that are used to following the drums for a since of time might find it hard to feel the pulse but that's why the work so well together. JD almost vomit styling drumming can be overwhelming if it wasn't for DOMi slow and simple way of laying the main idea over it all to give you that feel. This is something similar Prince would do with tracks like The Beautiful Ones where the drums are a bit hard to follow and then the keys come in with this soild 8th note rhythm that ties all of it together. This is a theme in DOMi & JD Beck's music where DOMi is  really laying down the path and JD is ad libbing in the pockets.</p>
